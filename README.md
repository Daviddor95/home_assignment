## Quick Start

### Phase 1 Solution
For setup instructions:
- Navigate to the `phase1_solution/` directory
- Follow the detailed instructions in [`phase1_solution/README.md`](./phase1_solution/README.md)

### Phase 2 Solution
For setup instructions:
- Navigate to the `phase2_solution/` directory  
- Follow the detailed instructions in [`phase2_solution/README.md`](./phase2_solution/README.md)

## Prerequisites

Each phase may have different system requirements and dependencies. Please check the respective README files for:
- Required software versions
- System dependencies
- Environment setup instructions
- Configuration requirements

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. First check the phase-specific README file for troubleshooting guidance
2. Ensure you're following the correct phase's installation procedure
3. Verify that all prerequisites are properly installed
